)F FUNCTION -
     To provide access to various system symbols you can now use the
     JCL SET statement.

     This facility is provided via an IEFUJV exit routine that
     substitutes the variable symbols found on JCL SET statements when
     the job is read into the system.
     Due to the timing of this substitution, the use of symbols that
     are specific to a given system need to be used only with jobs that
     are known to be read into the system where they will execute.

     For example, if you use the &SYSNAME. symbol this will be changed
     to the name of the system where the job was read.  This MAY not
     be what you expect at execution time.
     Also, if you have systems in different time zones, the use of
     time related symbols may not be what you expect.

     The above caveats are a few of the reasons that IBM has not
     provided the use of system symbols for batch jobs.
     So, please be aware of these restrictions and use at your own risk.

)X SYNTAX -
     // SET YOURSYM=&symbol.

     Supported symbols will be substituted for the &SYMBOL field.

     To abide by IBM symbol rules, please terminate the symbol
     with a period.  The exit routine will allow a blank to be used
     as a terminator but this may change in the future.

     Date and time symbols can be altered by using addition and
     subtraction.  This is done by specifying &SYMBOL+n. and
     &SYMBOL=n.
     Example:
     // SET LASTWEEK=&ZJDATE-7.
     This will give you the Julian date for 7 days prior to today.

     The general rule for the "Math" process is that the number will
     be in units of the symbol.
     Date symbols will be adjusted by the number of days.
     Year symbols will be adjusted by the number of years.
     Month symbols will be adjusted by the number of months.
     Hour symbols will be adjusted by the number of hours.
     Minute symbols will be adjusted by the number of minutes.

)O OPERANDS -
     The following variables may be used on JCL SET statements.
        &DDMMYY.
        &DDMMYYYY.
        &MMDDYY.
        &MMDDYYYY.
        &YYDDD.
        &YYDDMM.
        &YYMMDD.
        &YYYY/DDD.
        &YYYYDDD.
        &YYYYDDMM.
        &YYYYMMDD.
        &ZDAY.
        &ZDOW.
        &ZHH.
        &ZJDATE.
        &ZJOBID.
        &ZJOBNAME.
        &ZMM.
        &ZMONTH.
        &ZMONTHCH.
        &ZMOY.
        &ZSMFID.
        &ZSS.
        &ZSTDYEAR.
        &ZTIME.

        &ZTIMET.
        &ZWD.
        &ZWEEKDAY.
        &ZYEAR.

     As well as the above internally defined symbols, all the symbols
     displayed via "D SYMBOLS" can be used.
     Most of these can be found in parmlib's IEASYMxx.
