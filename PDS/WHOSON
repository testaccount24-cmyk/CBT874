)F Function
  The WHOSON command is used to display a list of all the active TSO
  users, ssh users, and zOSMF users (who may be Zowe users).

  This is accomplished by using the SDSF REXX interface and then to
  make it easier to review the report when under ISPF the code uses
  the STEMEDIT command.

  Note: zOSMF users appear in the SDSF DA report as TSO users as they
        appear as TSO address spaces. These users may be true zOSMF
        users who are using some service that requires TSO, or they
        may be Zowe Explorer users.
