)X SYNTAX-

   CSCF  < JOBNAME( JOB-NAME | '*' ) >
         < ASID( DECIMAL-ASID | X'HEXADECIMAL-ASID' ) >
         < CANCEL | NOCANCEL >
         < FORCE  | NOFORCE  >
         < TIME   | NOTIME   >
         < WAITTIME( MMMM,SS ) >
         < CPUTIME(  MMMM,SS ) >
         < LIST >

   ALIASES:

        JOBNAME   - USERID
        NOCANCEL  - NCANCEL
        NOFORCE   - NFORCE

        CANCEL    -  MAKE THE A/S CANCELABLE
        NOCANCEL  -  MAKE THE A/S NON-CANCELABLE
        FORCE     -  MAKE THE A/S FORCEABLE     (uses MEMTERM bit)
        NOFORCE   -  MAKE THE A/S NON-FORCEABLE (uses MEMTERM bit)
        LIST      -  GIVE BEFORE AND AFTER IMAGES OF THE CB'S.

  'CSCF' WITHOUT (NO)CANCEL, (NO)FORCE, (NO)TIME  GIVES THE STATUS
  'CSCF' WITHOUT 'JOBNAME' OR 'ASID' WORKS ON INVOKER'S A/S .
  'CSCF' WITH 'JOBNAME' AND 'ASID' REQUIRES A MATCH ON BOTH.
  'CSCF' WITH 'JOBNAME' BUT NOT 'ASID' UPDATES ONLY IF 'JOBNAME' IS
         UNIQUE.  OTHERWISE, IT ISSUES ERROR MESSAGE.

  'CSCF CANCEL'  ASSUMES 'FORCE'   , UNLESS 'NOFORCE' IS SPECIFIED.
  'CSCF TIME'    ASSUMES 'FORCE'   , UNLESS 'NOFORCE' IS SPECIFIED.
  'CSCF NOFORCE' ASSUMES 'NOCANCEL', UNLESS 'CANCEL'  IS SPECIFIED.
  'CSCF NOFORCE' ASSUMES 'NOTIME',   UNLESS 'TIME'    IS SPECIFIED.

  WARNING:  DO NOT LET AN A/S TERMINATE WHEN IT IS NON-FORCEABLE.
            ALWAYS RESET TO FORCEABLE BEFORE TSO LOGOFF.

            INITIATED JOBS HAVE TWO CSCB'S, SO THE ONE WHICH
            ASCBJBNI POINTS TO IS USED, IF ASCBJBNI IS NON-ZERO.

            IF ASCBJBNI IS ZERO, THEN ASCBCSCB IS USED TO FIND
            THE CSCB.  THIS MEANS YOU CAN ONLY UPDATE AN INIT'S
            CANCEL/NONCANCEL STATUS IF IT IS IDLE.

  ASM SYSLIBS:  SYS1.MACLIB, SYS1.AMODGEN

  BITS FLIPPED:  FORCE  - ASCBNOMT BIT OF ASCBFLG2 IN ASCB
                 CANCEL - CHCL BIT OF CHACT IN CSCB
                 TIME   - ASCBTOFF BIT OF ASCBRCTF IN ASCB
                 CPUTIME- ASCBJSTL WORD IN ASCB
                 WAITTIME-ASCBSWTL WORD IN ASCB

  ASCBTOFF  CONTROLS WHETHER ANY TIMING (S322 OR S522) IS DONE.
            IF IT IS '1', THE JOB IS NOT TIMED, AND THE CPUTIME
            AND WAITTIME VALUES ARE IGNORED.  IF IT IS '0', THE
            CPUTIME AND WAITTIME ARE ENFORCED, SUBJECT TO THE SMF
            EXIT IEFUTL.
