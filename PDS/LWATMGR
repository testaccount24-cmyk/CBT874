)F Purpose -
     This program allows you to display and update the authorized
     command tables that have been loaded into your address space.
)X Syntax -
         LWATMGR ADD      {table-name}   NAME(name)
         LWATMGR BUILD    {table-name}   LIST(dsnameÝ(member)¨)
         LWATMGR DELETE   {table-name}   NAME(name)
         LWATMGR DISPLAY  {table-name}
         LWATMGR RELOAD   {table-name}   LOADLIB(dsname)
         LWATMGR REPLACE  {table-name}   NAME(old)  NEWNAME(new)
         LWATMGR UPDATE   {table-name}   PARMLIB(dsname(member))

   The table names are:    AUTHTSF
                           AUTHCMD
                           AUTHPGM
                           NOTBKGND
                Or "ALL" to process all of the above.
)O Functions -
))ADD   - This will add a new command or program name into the
          specific table.

   Example: AUTHTSF ADD AUTHPGM NAME(mypgmnm)

))BUILD - This will re-create multiple tables at one time by
          reading the 1st 8 bytes from the LIST data set.  The
          LIST data set entries must follow specific identifier
          records. "---AP---" for the AUTHTSF table, "---E2---"
          for the AUTHCMD table, "---E8---" for the AUTHPGM table
          and '---NS---' for the NOTBKGND table.  If a list
          section within this input file contains no entries the
          table will not be updated.
          As the LIST data set only uses the 1st 8 bytes of each
          record, the LRECL may be as little as 8.  This allows
          for a lot of tables in a very small amount of space.

   Example: AUTHTSF BUILD LIST(fb8.pds(list01))

))DELETE - This will remove an existing command or program name from
          the specific table.

   Example: AUTHTSF DELETE AUTHPGM NAME(mypgmnm)

))DISPLAY - This will display information about the various
            authorization tables and their contents.
            This function allows you to specify a table of "ALL" or
            specify no table name at all which will default to "ALL".

   Example: AUTHTSF DISPLAY AUTHCMD

))RELOAD - This allows you to load loadmodule versions of the various
           tables.  The input LOADMODULE library must have the tables
           linked as alias names to IKJTABLS.

   Example: AUTHTSF RELOAD LOAD(test.loadlib)

))REPLACE - This allows you to replace an entry in a specific table.

   Example: AUTHTSF REPLACE AUTHPGM NAME(iebcopy) NEWNAME(XYZcopy)

))UPDATE - This allows you to update tables based on input with
           synatax identical to the IKJTSOxx parmlib member.

   Example: AUTHTSF UPDATE ALL PARMLIB('SYS1.PARMLIB(IKJTSO99)')
