)F FUNCTION -

  TSO command to display various aspects of running TSO sessions,
   especially LOGON date and time, session origin, terminal size,
   and whether the session took its authorizations from an
   APF-authorized STEPLIB.

  Environment is APF-Authorized.

  Example output:

  Explanations:

  All the TSO sessions will be displayed, and sorted in
  ASID order.  Most of the fields are self-explanatory,
  except as follows.

  STLB (if non-zero) indicates that one or more of the TSO
  authorization tables, have been loaded from the IKJTABLS
  module in an APF-authorized STEPLIB, instead of being
  copied from the IKJTSOxx PARMLIB member.  This points out
  (more or less) "privileged" TSO userids.

  T indicates the origin of the TSO session.  In most cases
  it is R, meaning the session was defined in RACF.  If it
  is U, then the session was defined in SYS1.UADS.  If it is
  S, then the session is STARTING.

  ROW  COL indicate the TSO session's terminal size.
