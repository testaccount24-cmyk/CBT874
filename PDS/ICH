)F FUNCTION - ICH Rexx Exec Facility to Update Racf Exits   01/15/2010


    PURPOSE:

         This exec will allow a user to update/delete/remove a
         Racf Security Server Exit dynamically without requiring
         an IPL outage.

         This exec can perform any of four functions.

         It can UPDATE or DELETE a module from dynamic LPA (just
         as the SETPROG ADD/DELETE LPA MVS command does) or it
         can REMOVE (unpoint) a RACF exit or REPOINT a RACF Exit.
         REMOVE takes the exit out of RACF service and REPOINT
         puts the exit back into service.

         These four functions are documented below.

         In order for RACF (Security Server) to recognize the change
         in the exit module's status, the RCVT (RACF COMMUNICATION
         VECTOR TABLE) pointer must be repointed to the new Entry
         point address (for an Update function) or it must be
         zeroed to remove and exit from RACF use.

         This exec may be called in TEST/SIMULATE mode to simulate
         an update to an exit.

         This exec calls APF-Authorized program ICHLOADR to perform
         these functions.

         The Load Library containing the Racf Exit to fetch for the
         LPA Update must also be in the APF List.  Normally, this
         Loadlib would be SYS1.LPALIB (this is the default load
         library if not specified when the ICH REXX exec is invoked),
         but it can be overridden with the DA(dsname) parm when ICH
         is invoked.

    FUNCTIONS:

         There are four functions for this exec.

         1) UPDATE - This function loads a new version of a RACF
            exit into dynamic LPA (CSA memory) (same as the
            SETPROG LPA,ADD command).  It also repoints RACF to
            use the updated module (updates the exits RCVT pointer).
            The user must specify the load library to fetch the exit
            from to load into dynamic LPA (CSA).  This exec will
            default to load library SYS1.LPALIB unless specified
            otherwise when the exec is invoked.
            (Does the same function as the SETPROG LPA,ADD MVS
            command except that it also updates the RACF RCVT
            pointer which points to the updated version of the
            exit in LPA (CSA) storage.)

            If none of these four function values are passed as
            parameters to this exec, it will default to use the
            UPDATE function.

         2) DELETE - This function deletes a RACF exit from dynamic
            LPA (same as SETPROG LPA,DELETE command) and then also
            loads zeros into the Racf RCVT pointer to indicate to
            RACF that the exit is not being used (until the next
            IPL or next dynamic update).
            (Does the same function as the SETPROG LPA,DELETE
            MVS command except that it also unpoints (zeros) the
            RACF RCVT pointer which points to it in LPA storage.)

         3) REMOVE - This function only unpoints the Racf exit
            (loads zeros into the RACF RCVT point for that Exit)
            to take the exit out of RACF service (until the next
            IPL or next dynamic update). This function does not
            actually affect the exit module itself.  It only
            updates the RACF RCVT pointer which points to it.

         4) REPOINT - This function obtains the most current EP
            address for the exit from LPA storage and then repoints
            RACF to the exit to put the exit back into service for
            RACF to use.  This would normally be done after a
            previous REMOVE function has taken the exit out of
            service for RACF to put the exit back into service.
            This function does not actually affect the exit
            module in LPA storage.  It only update the RAXF RCVT
            RCVT pointer which points to it.
            This function is the opposite of the REMOVE function
            and can be used subsequent to issuing REMOVE funtion
            to put the exit back into service.

)O OPERANDS - ICH Rexx Exec Facility to Update Racf Exits

    OPERANDS:

     MEMBERNAME - Specifies the Racf Exit member name for which to
                  obtain the absolute storage address.
                  THis must be the first positional parameter passed
                  to ICH (unless a "?" is passed for help query).

     DA(dsname) - Specifies the load library dataset name to be used
                  to fetch the Racf Module from to stow in CSA for
                  the LLA update. If this parameter is omitted, the
                  Racf exit module will be fetched from default
                  load library 'SYS1.LPALIB'.

     DSN(dsname)- Same as DA(dsname).  See above.

     The following four parameters are processed as the FUNCTION
     literals to be passed to program ICHLOADR.
     If none of these four function values are entered, the
     default function is "UPDATE".

     UPDATE     - Specifies that the module passed should be updated
                  in CSA (LLA Update) to replace the existing
                  module in LLA and repoint the RACF RCVT pointer
                  to that version of the exit.
                  This is the DEFAULT FUNCTION if no function
                  parameters are entered when the 'ICH' exec is
                  invoked.

     DELETE     - Specifies that the current version of the Racf Exit
                  should be deleted from dynamic LPA (CSA) storage.
                  Also, the RACF RCVT pointer to the exit is zerod
                  (unpointed) to remove it from RACF service (until
                  the next IPL or next dynamic LPA update).

     REMOVE     - Specifies that the module passed should be removed
                  from RACF service (until the next IPL or until the
                  next dynamic update). The RACF RCVT pointer to the
                  the exit is zerod (unpointed).
                  The exit is not touched or updated in LPA (CSA)
                  storage.  Only the pointer is reset to Zero.

     REPOINT    - Specifies that the module passed should be repointed
                  with the current version of the exit found in LPA
                  (CSA) storage.  The RACF RCVT point to the exit is
                  updated to point to the current version of the exit
                  in LPA storage.  The module itself is not touched
                  or updated in LPA storage.

     The following two parameters are processed as the TESTPARM
     literals to be passed to program ICHLOADR as execution-time
     linkage parameters to make a 'test' pass without updating
     any pointers.

     TEST       - Specifies that a TEST execution should be performed
                  without any update action.
                  Performs the same action as the SIMULATE
                  parameter.

     SIMULATE   - Specifies that a TEST execution should be performed
                  without any update action.
                  Performs the same action as the TEST parameter.

    CUSTOMIZATION:

       Program ICHLOADR must reside in an APF-authorized Load
       Library (either PDS or PDSE).  This load library can
       be in the LinkList or otherwise.  The user has to option
       in this exec to call program ICHLOADR via a search through
       the LinkList or via an explicit call to a Load Library.

       If ICHLOADR is called explicitly from a load library, you
       must comment out the call thru the Linklist and uncomment
       the call from a specific library. Do a FIND on the
       You must change the loadlib name whic contains the ICHLOADR
       eyecather text "<= CHANGE LOADLIB" to modify the specific
       load library.

       Program ICHLOADR must reside in the 'Authorized Programs'
       section of the IKJTSOxx MVS parmlib member.

       It is also recommended that ICHLOADR 'program access
       control' protected in RACF to restrict its use to only those
       users who have a legimate need to use it.
