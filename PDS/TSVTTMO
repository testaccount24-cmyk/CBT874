)F FUNCTION -

  Display/Change the TSO LOGON screen timeout value.

  The TSO command TSVTTMO will display the status of your
  TSO LOGON screen timeout value, in minutes.  This is a
  new command applicable to z/OS 2.4 and higher.

  You can change this value, both in the TSVT (where it counts)
  and the TPVT (where it shows), by entering a number after the
  command name.  Entering 0, will call the LOGON screen to never
  time out.

  Example:   LOGON userid

      This gets you a logon screen, and you have nnn minutes
      to enter a password before the screen times out.
      (Default is 5 minutes)
