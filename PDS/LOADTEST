   Documentation:   This program is meant to be run as a batch
                    program, APF authorized when it is used
                    to reload the TEST parameters from TESTIN
                    card input.


   Function:   To display/change values of the TEST IKJTSOxx
               PARMLIB settings as they are represented
               internally in the TPT, TCT, SCT control
               blocks.

   JCL:

   SUBROUTINE:

   LOADTN   -  PRODUCES REPORTS AT THE END OF PROCESSING.
               LOADTN is a separate called program.

   DD NAME DESCRIPTIONS:

   SYSPRINT DD IS THE ONLY REQUIRED DDNAME, AND IT ALWAYS HAS
   TO BE PRESENT.  IT PRODUCES A REPORT REFLECTING THE INITIAL
   STATE OF THE TEST CONTROL BLOCKS.

   SYSPRINT also contains any relevant messages if the TEST control
            blocks have been changed (messages at the bottom).

   TESTOUT  DD :  PRODUCES A CARD DECK IN TESTIN FORM, WHICH WILL
                  REPRODUCE THE LOAD OF THE CURRENT TEST PARAMETERS
                  (BEFORE ANY CHANGES OCCUR).

   TESTOUT2 DD :  PRODUCES THE TESTOUT-TYPE CARD DECK, BUT AT THE
                  END OF PROCESSING.  IF CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE,
                  THEY WILL BE REFLECTED HERE.

   SYSPRNT2 DD :  SIMILAR REPORT TO SYSPRINT DD, BUT DONE AT THE
                  END OF PROCESSING, SO CHANGES (IF ANY) ARE
                  REPORTED.  THE SYSPRNT2 DD NAME DOES NOT CONTAIN
                  ANY EXTRA MESSAGES, THE WAY SYSPRINT DOES.

   THE TESTIN DD NAME IS NECESSARY IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE TEST
   CONTROL BLOCKS.

   THE TESTIN DD NAME CONTAINS CARDS TO CHANGE THE TEST FIELD
   ENTRIES.  WHEN LOADTEST IS RUN WITH THE TESTOUT DD NAME, THEN A
   PROPERLY FORMATTED TESTIN DECK IS CREATED FROM THE EXISTING TEST
   PARMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN EFFECT.  THIS FILE MAY BE EDITED, AND
   USED AS FURTHER TESTIN INPUT TO ANOTHER LOADTEST RUN.

   TESTIN AND TESTOUT DD NAMES ARE NOW OPTIONAL.  IF TESTIN IS LEFT
   OUT, THEN NO CHANGES TO THE TEST PARAMETERS ARE PERFORMED.
   SYSPRNT2 AND TESTOUT2, WHICH SHOW THE STATE OF THE TEST FIELDS
   AFTER ANY CHANGES WERE MADE, ARE OPTIONAL AS WELL.

   IF TESTOUT IS LEFT OUT, THEN TESTIN-FORMATTED OUTPUT FOR THE
   CURRENT TEST PARMS, IS LEFT OUT.

   TESTIN DD REQUIREMENTS:  (BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THE COLUMNS)

        The string --TCT-- from column 1
        indicates that the following entries
        will be put in the TCT table.
        These names go from columns 1 thru 8.

        The string --SCT-- from column 1
        indicates that the following entries
        will be put in the SCT table.
        The command name goes from columns 1 thru 8.
        The program module name which is executed
        by that command goes from columns 9 thru 16.

        You have to be very exact with the columns.

        An asterisk (*) in column 1 causes that card
        to be ignored.  So does a space in column 1.

   THE TESTOUT DD NAME PRODUCES A PROPERLY FORMATTED TESTIN
   FILE, TO RELOAD THE PREVIOUS TEST CONFIGURATION.

    Function:   To display/change values of the TEST IKJTSOxx
                PARMLIB settings as they are represented
                internally in the TPT, TCT, SCT control
                blocks.

    DDNAME SUMMARY:

    SYSPRINT - Produces a report of the CURRENT (before loading)
               TEST information.  Contains diagnosis messages.

    SYSPRNT2 - Produces a similar report to SYSPRINT, but at the
               end of processing.  This report reflects changes,
               if any, to the TEST parameters.

    TESTOUT  - Converts the CURRENT TEST information into input
               cards, to feed into another TESTLOAD invocation,
               so the current information can be reloaded by
               TESTLOAD (in case you want to back the TESTIN
               changes out).

    TESTOUT2 - Same as TESTOUT, but at end of procesing, and
               reflecting any changes to the tables (if any)
               that have been made.

    TESTIN   - Cards to reload new TEST information into storage.

    RETURN CODES:   0 - SUCCESSFUL DISPLAY and/or SUCCESSFUL
                        CHANGE.

                    4 - Original tables were damaged, and TESTIN
                        cards were available, so that new tables
                        were constructed from the TESTIN cards.

                    8 - TPT or TCT or SCT corrupted.  See error
                        messages in the SYSPRINT DD name.  This
                        can happen if there is no TESTIN card deck.

                        (Hint:  You can create new TEST tables
                                if there is a valid TESTIN deck.)

                   16 - Program was not APF-authorized to make
                        control block replacements.

   Change Log:
     2016/08/07 - 1.0 - Initial version - Tested with TSO/E Version
                        4.

     2019/06/03 - 1.1 - Turned this into a batch program, to produce
                        output compatible with the LOADTEST program.
                        (DDNAME=TESTOUT)

     2019/06/14 - 1.2 - Added TESTIN DD name, to allow reloading of
                        the TEST tables.

     2019/06/14 - 1.3 - TESTIN and TESTOUT DD names have been made
                        optional.  If they are left out then their
                        output is not produced.  If TESTIN is left
                        out, then no changes to the TEST parameters
                        are made, and the program does not have to
                        be executed APF-authorized.  The SYSPRINT
                        DD name always has to be there.
                        Return code 16 if program not APF-authorized
                        -and- the TESTIN DD is coded in the JCL.
                        (I.e. you are trying to load a new table)

     2019/06/18 - 1.4 - Take some steps to validate the TESTIN
                        file entries.
                        Allow the program to show the state of the
                        file entries after any changes have been
                        made.  DD names:  SYSPRNT2 and TESTOUT2
                        correspond to SYSPRINT and TESTOUT, but
                        they are created after the program has done
                        any actions, when TESTIN has been coded.
                        If no actions were performed, then SYSPRNT2
                        and TESTOUT2 would not show changes.

     2019/06/19 - 1.5 - Increased size of tables.  Removed size
                        restriction of X'FF'.  They are somewhat
                        bigger now.  See label WORKAREA for actual
                        table size limits.

                        If the old table is corrupted, and we have
                        a good TESTIN card deck, then we can build
                        a new table anyway.  (Return code = 4)

   Programming Notes:

     The TEST command information from the IKJTSOxx member of
     parmlib, is reflected in 3 control blocks:  TPT, TCT, SCT.

     The TPT is pointed to by the TEST address at x'28' off
     the beginning of the TPVT.  The TPT points to all the rest
     of the information, as per the macro description below.

     The TEST information in storage consists of 3 control blocks:

     TPT  -  General information:  Points to the TCT (names of
             programs) and the SCT (names of subcommands and the
             subprogram names that they invoke).  Size = x'28'

     TCT  -  List of programs which are callable from TEST or
             TESTAUTH.   Size = variable

     SCT  -  List of subcommands (first 8 characters) and the names
             of the subprograms which they call (second 8 characters)
                         Size = variable
