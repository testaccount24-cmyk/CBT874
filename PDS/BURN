)F FUNCTION -

  The TSO command BURN will terminate an address space,
  as if you would FORCE it.  BURN operates by issuing a
  CALLRTM TYPE=MEMTERM, against that address space.

  Since a single jobname may have multiple ASIDs,
  you want to be very careful, which address space
  you want to terminate.  So there is an ASID parameter
  as well as a JOBNAME parameter associated with
  the BURN command.

  If you terminate an ASID that has multiple jobnames
  attached to it, all those jobnames will be burned.

  If you enter a JOBNAME(jobname) parameter, you will
  be prompted to enter an ASID number in hex.
  (See the examples below....)

)X SYNTAX  -

       BURN  JOBNAME(jobname) ASID(hhhh)
       BURN  JOB(jobname)     ASID(hhhh)
       BURN  JOBNAME(partj*)
                              where * is a wildcard
                              which will list all
                              jobnames beginning with
                              "partj"

  REQUIRED - either JOBname( )  or ASID(  )
  DEFAULTS - NONE
  ALIAS    - NONE

       Prompts will be returned after entering the initial
        sub-parameters.

       Answer the prompts, and enter the job number to
        be burned, in hex.

       * is a wildcard in the JOBNAME, if entered as jjj*

       If no JOB or ASID entered, then the program will
        issue a message and terminate.

       If J entered, the program will prompt for jobname.

       If A entered, the program will prompt for ASID number.

       If an incorrect prompt is entered, the program will
        prompt for a correct answer.

       If 3 incorrect tries are entered, then the program
        will terminate.  (This is a convenient way to get out
        of the program.  Just enter 3 incorrect tries, or
        enter PA1, either of which will get you out of the
        program.)

 Examples:     DO NOT DO THIS UNLESS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.
               -- --- -- ---- ------ ---------- ---------
               (and ONLY do it to a job or address space
               that you need to forcibly terminate.)

    Example 1:
    ------- -

    BURN JOB(JES2)            (as a TSO command)

    THE FOLLOWING ASID ARE VALID FOR THE JOBNAME:
    ASID=001C  JOBNAME=JES2
    WHICH ADDRESS SPACE WOULD YOU LIKE TO BURN ?
      ENTER ITS VALUE IN HEX:
    1c
    JOBNAME JES2     FOR ASID 001C BURNED


    Example 2:
    ------- -

    BURN JOB(JES2*)           (as a TSO command)

    THE FOLLOWING ASID ARE VALID FOR THE JOBNAME:
    ASID=001C  JOBNAME=JES2
    ASID=0024  JOBNAME=JES2AUX
    ASID=0025  JOBNAME=JES2MON
    WHICH ADDRESS SPACE WOULD YOU LIKE TO BURN ?
      ENTER ITS VALUE IN HEX:
    1c
    JOBNAME JES2     FOR ASID 001C BURNED


)O OPERANDS -
))JOBNAME(jobname) - Jobname of address space to be burned.
))JOBNAME(partj*)  - Partial jobname of address space to be
                     burned.
))ASID(nnnn)       - ASID of address space to be burned, in
                     hex.
