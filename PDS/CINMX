)F FUNCTION -

 Change the in-storage values for the TSO TRANSMIT (XMIT) command.

  The CINMX TSO command is an APF authorized TSO command to
    change the value of the XMIT OUTLIM number or the XMIT
    warning threshold number, or the XMIT warning interval
    number.

    If only a number is entered after CINMX, then changes
    will be done to the OUTLIM value of the XMIT command.

    Changes are done directly (in Key 0) to the INMXPARM control
    block in common storage, and are valid until the next PARMLIB
    UPDATE(xx), SET IKJTSO=xx, or IPL.  The values entered apply
    to the entire LPAR, and all the users of that MVS instance
    (so be careful).

    The number entered is tested to see if it is numeric.  If
    not, an error message is issued.  However......

    An exception to this will happen if the first character of
    the operand is a W or an I.  In that case, the number
    afterward will be treated as the number to change the XMIT
    Warning Threshold or Warning Interval (respectively).  A
    space does not have to follow this W or I (but it can).  If
    a number immediately follows the W or I, its entire value
    will be recognized, and it will be validated as numeric in
    its entirety.

)X SYNTAX  -
    CINMX   nnnnnnnn     (changes OUTLIM value to this number)
      or
    CINMX W nnnnnnnn     (changes Warn Threshold to this number)
      or
    CINMX I nnnnnnnn     (changes Warn Interval to this number)

  REQUIRED - nnnnnnnn    (a numeric value, up to 10 digits)
  DEFAULT  - NONE
  ALIAS    -
  NOTE     - The CINMX command is supported for previous releases
             of TSO/E, and has been tested on MVS releases back to
             MVS/ESA 5.2.2 and forward to z/OS 2.3.

)O OPERANDS -
))nnnnnnn    -  A numeric value alone, will cause the update of
                the OUTLIM value of the XMIT (TRANSMIT) command,
                to the value specified.  The old value will be
                displayed for your reference (especially if you
                want to set it back later).

))W nnnnnnn  -  A letter W followed by a numeric value, will
                cause the update of the Warn Threshold value
                for the XMIT command.  The old value will be
                displayed for your reference.

))I nnnnnnn  -  A letter I followed by a numeric value, will
                cause the update of the Warn Interval value
                for the XMIT command.  The old value will be
                displayed for your reference.
