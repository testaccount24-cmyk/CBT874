)F FUNCTION -
     The ADDTO command is used to concatenate datasets to a currently
     allocated DD.  These NEW datasets will be placed in front of the
     existing allocated files.

     This command is useful if your installation has a "STOCK" LOGON
     procedure, and users wish to place there own private libraries in
     front of this list of libraries.  With the ADDTO command, it is not
     necessary for the user to reallocate the DD specifying ALL the
     libraries in the LOGON proc.
     This also makes it easier for the SYSPROG to ADD, REMOVE or RENAME
     libraries in the LOGON procedure.
)X SYNTAX  -
     ADDTO ddname (library list) < CREATE > < REMOVE >

                    If the dataset name is not within quotes, it will
                    be assumed that it is the for the current users's
                    prefix.
