          Documentation for the IKJTPVT control block
          ------------- --- --- ------- ------- -----
*
*    Particular reference is given to the EESCB control block here.
*    For further reference, see CBT File 731, member MODGEN.
*
*    The TPVT control block is mostly created by settings in the
*     PARMLIB member, IKJTSOxx.
*    The TPVT control block is not publicly documented by IBM.
*    We have documented the TPVT and some other TPVT-related
*     control blocks.  The console command D IKJTSO will display
*     much of the contents of the TPVT.
*
*    A nice command to display all the TPVT control block fields,
*     is the SHOWTPVT command whose source code is in CBT File 731.
*
*    The EESCB control block is chained off the TPVT, and it points
*     to names for TSO individual userlogs and to the currently used
*     "Broadcast Dataset" name (default name is SYS1.BRODCAST).
*    TPVT stands for TSO Parmlib Vector Table.
*    EESCB stands for TSO SEND PARMLIB Control Block.
*
*    To display most of the contents of the EESCB control block,
*     use console command D IKJTSO,SEND or our TSO command from
*     CBT File 731 called EESCB.
*
*    Three versions of EESCB exist to date (until z/OS 1.13 at least).
*
*    v1 - ESA 5.2.2  to OS/390 1.3       IKJE1SCB
*    v2 - OS/390 2.4 to z/OS 1.2         IKJE2SCB
*    v3 - z/OS 1.3   and above.          IKJEESCB  (in SYS1.MODGEN)
*
*    The following instructions tell you how to get to the TPVT,
*     and to other control blocks that are connected to the TPVT.
*
*    Notation:  j is like a LOAD instruction in assembler
*               j10 means virtual storage, value hex 10
*               j+9c means LOAD what is in hex 9c off the previous
*                    address
*               etc.
*
*    This notation is used by the LOOK TSO command to browse storage.
*    LOOK can be found on CBT File 264, load module on CBT File 035.
*
*    You may need the authorized TSO command called UKEYCSA (File 264)
*     to be able to use LOOK without its abending.  If you need UKEYCSA
*     to allow allocation of Key 8 CSA in your system, please reset it
*     to its previous value, after you've finished using LOOK.
*     (This is relevant only for z/OS 1.9 thru z/OS 2.3.)
*
*    For z/OS 2.4 and higher, you may only use the APF-authorized
*     version of LOOK, which has been fixed to show 64-bit addresses.
