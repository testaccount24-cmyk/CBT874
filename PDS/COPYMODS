OPTION RULES:
------ -----

Options NOT containing a value can be set either in PARM or in SYSIN.
Options containing a value are set in SYSIN with keyword in column 1.
Examples of options containing a value:

     OUTVOLALL=volser      (up to 6 characters)
     TAPEOWNER=owner name  (up to 10 characters)
     FILELIMIT=nnn         (numeric)
     LABELIMIT=nnn         (numeric)
     PRINTRCDS=nnn         (numeric)
     WRITELTMS=nnn         (numeric)

If two words set the same option, SYSIN overrides PARM, and the later
  setting overrides all earlier settings.
Default options are set automatically, but can be overridden explicitly.
  Default options are set first, and can therefore be overridden using
  either PARM settings or SYSIN settings.
SYSIN overrides PARM.  Later overrides earlier.
If the SYSIN DD name is not coded in the JCL, then no attempt will be
  made to OPEN it.  If it is coded, it will be OPENed and scanned.

There are 10 parm flag bits in the COPYMODS program.  As of the current
  release, the first 7 of these are used.  This help file tells you
  which bits are set by each option.

All tape files declared to the COPYMODS program must have LABEL=BLP
  coded in their DD names.  COPYMODS treats all tape labels only as
  data, and does its own diagnosis, as to what is a label and what is
  not.


HOW TO USE THIS HELP FILE:
--- -- --- ---- ---- ----
When you run COPYMODS, look at the OPTIONS report at the top.  If you
don't understand the meaning of an option setting, do an FIND on that
setting in this file, and then (we hope), you'll see the meanings
of that option.

LTMSKIP   -  PARMFLG1 - X'20' - When copying a tape, don't copy any
                                leading tape marks, but skip over them.

             aliases  - SKIPLIM
             opposite - COPYLTM, LTMCOPY   (copy leading tape marks)
             reason   - DOS/VSE tapes and foreign tapes, can come into
                         an MVS system, and it is hard to read them,
                         because they start with leading tape marks.
                         COPYMODS automatically will tell you how many
                         leading tape marks there are, and will skip to
                         the data that comes afterwards.  You have the
                         option of including these leading tape marks
                         in the copied tapes, or eliminating them from
                         the copied tapes.

LABELS    -  PARMFLG1 - X'DE' - Print info for all labels.
                                (This option uses multiple flags,
                                 because there is a separate flag
                                 to print each type of label.)

             aliases  - LBLINFO, PRINTL
             opposite - NOLABEL, NOLABL

HDR1      -  PARMFLG1 - X'02' - Display HDR1 Labels
HDR2      -  PARMFLG1 - X'04' - Display HDR2 Labels
EOF1      -  PARMFLG1 - X'08' - Display EOF1 Labels
EOF2      -  PARMFLG1 - X'10' - Display EOF2 Labels
EOV1      -  PARMFLG1 - X'40' - Display EOV1 Labels
EOV2      -  PARMFLG1 - X'80' - Display EOV2 Labels

             opposite - NOHDR1, NOHDR2, HOEOF1, NOEOF2, NOEOV1, NOEOF2

HDRS      -  PARMFLG1 - X'06' - Display header labels
EOFS      -  PARMFLG1 - X'18' - Display EOF labels
EOVS      -  PARMFLG1 - X'C0' - Display EOV labels

             opposite - NOHDRS, NOEOFS, NOEOVS

CHGVOL    -  PARMFLG2 - X'01' - Use JCL-specified volume serial for
                                 each copied output volume
             aliases  - JCLVOL, NEWVOL
             opposite - NOCHGVOL, NOJCLVOL, NONEWVOL

OUTVOLALL=volser  -  SYSIN keyword to specify output volume serial
                     for ALL output tapes equally.

             PARMFLG2 - X'40' - (set automatically by OUTVOLALL keyword)

VOLLBL    -  PARMFLG2 - X'02' - Print detail of VOL1 label if found.
                                (set as default)
             opposite - NOVOLLBL

EOVCHG    -  PARMFLG2 - X'04' - If an EOVx label is found, change it,
                                 in the copied tape, to an EOFx label.
             aliases  - EOV2EOF, EOVTOEOF
             opposite - NOEOVCHG
             reason   - Sometimes a tape is created by splicing 2
                         tapes together, and the first one has an EOV1
                         and EOV2 label set at the end.  MVS will not
                         be able to read past them in the copied tape,
                         unless these are changed to EOF1 and EOF2.

READ      -  PARMFLG2 - X'08' - Read only. Don't copy the input tape.
             aliases  - READONLY, NOWRITE
             opposite - WRITE
             note     - READ together with SHOOVL (Show Output Volumes)
                         will read the input tape, and show the first
                         80 bytes of each output tape.

LABLDUMP  -  PARMFLG2 - X'10' - Dump all standard labels from the
                                 input tape to an FB-80 output file
                                 which is defined by a DD of LABLDUMP.
             opposite - NOLABLDU
             note     - LABLDUMP can be done at the same time as a
                         normal tape copy or a STRIP (which strips the
                         tape labels off the output tapes).  It also
                         works together with READ, when no tape copy
                         is done.

SYSIN     -  PARMFLG2 - X'20' - Read input parameters from a SYSIN DD
                                 card, after the PARM field is read.
                                 This is set on automatically if a
                                 SYSIN DD card is present in the JCL.

OUTVOL    -  PARMFLG2 - X'40' - This switch is set on automatically
                                 if OUTVOLALL=vvvvvv is coded in
                                 column 1 of the SYSIN DD.  This switch
                                 is also turned on if TAPEOWNER=xxxxxx
                                 is coded in SYSIN.
             opposite - NOOUTVOL
             notes    - TAPEOWNER in IBM (EBCDIC) tapes is 10 bytes
                         long, and embedded blanks can be included.
                        With ASCII tapes, the tape owner field is
                         14 bytes long.

LABADDIN  -  PARMFLG2 - X'80' - Add a previously prepared set of tape
                                 labels to NL output tapes.  Usually
                                 the labels have been stripped from
                                 a SL version of this tape and edited.
                                 Then they are spliced back into the
                                 NL version of the tape.  The label
                                 set is allocated using the LABADDIN
                                 DD name, and must be FB-80 in format.
             opposite - NOLABADD

BLKCNT    -  PARMFLG1 - X'01' - Correct the block count quantities in
                                 the EOF1 and EOV1 labels when copying
                                 to output tapes.  COPYMODS has just
                                 read how many blocks are in the input
                                 tape file and therefore, COPYMODS can
                                 adjust this number in the EOF1 and
                                 EOV1 labels.
             opposite - NOBLKCNT
             note     - See CORRBLKS which does this if adding external
                         labels.

CORRBLKS  -  PARMFLG3 - X'20' - If a set of labels has just been
                                 supplied via the LABADDIN option, it
                                 is very possible that the previous
                                 block counts on these EOF1 and EOV1
                                 labels might not match each actual
                                 file's block count.  Therefore
                                 COPYMODS will (under control of this
                                 option) adjust the block counts in the
                                 EOF1 and EOV1 labels to be accurate.
             opposite - NOCORRBL
             note     - See BLKCNT which does this when copying SL
                         tapes.

PRADDLBL  -  PARMFLG3 - X'10' - Print the external labels to be added,
                                 in the SYSPRINT report.
             opposite - NOPRADDL

NOEXNULL  -  PARMFLG3 - X'40' - When doing LABADDIN processing (adding
                                 labels to an NL tape), if there are
                                 more sets of labels than NL tape files,
                                 stop copying after the last NL file is
                                 found.
             alias    - NOSLNULL
             opposite - EXNULL, SLNULL
             note     - The opposite of this action, is to use up all
                         the extra label sets, by creating null SL files
                         at the end of the copied tapes.

LBLFIX    -  PARMFLG3 - X'80' - When doing LABADDIN processing (adding
                                 labels to an NL tape), maybe the last
                                 set of labels to be added is missing
                                 EOF1 and EOF2 labels.  Since the HDR1
                                 and HDR2 labels are almost identical
                                 to the EOF1 and EOF2 labels, we can
                                 reconstruct the missing EOF1 and EOF2
                                 labels, under control of this option.
             opposite - NOLBLFIX

INITVOLS  -  PARMFLG3 - X'01' - Initialize an IBM (EBCDIC) tape.
             alias    - INITTAPE
             opposite - NOINITVO
             notes    - This option will set the CHGVOL option on also,
                         and the initted tapes will have a volser equal
                         to the JCL volser.  Even if NOCHGVOL is set to
                         override, the volser of the created tapes
                         will still be equal to the JCL volser.

INASC3    -  PARMFLG5 - X'01' - Initialize an ASCII Type 3 tape.
                                PARMFLG5,X'80' (ASCII) option is set,
                                PARMFLG2,X'01' (CHGVOL) is also set,
                                together with this option.
             alias    - INASCII
             opposite - NOINASC3

INASC4    -  PARMFLG5 - X'02' - Initialize an ASCII Type 4 tape.
                                PARMFLG5,X'80' (ASCII) option is set,
                                PARMFLG2,X'01' (CHGVOL) is also set,
                                together with this option.
             opposite - NOINASC4

ASCII     -  PARMFLG5 - X'80' - Print all displays by translating the
                                ASCII labels and quantities to EBCDIC
                                so we can see them in SYSPRINT.  Also,
                                interpret the HEXPRT displays as ASCII
                                and not as EBCDIC.

LIMFILE   -  PARMFLG3 - X'02' - Limit the number of files to be copied
                                from the input tape.  This number is
                                set using the FILELIMIT=nnn keyword in
                                SYSIN.
             alias    - FILELIM
             opposite - NOLIMFIL
             notes    - If no FILELIMIT=nnn number is set in SYSIN,
                         then this option will not limit the number of
                         files copied.
                        If the input tape is standard labeled (SL) then
                         the COPYMODS program will attempt to interpret
                         the number of files copied as SL files, by
                         dividing the total number of files to be
                         copied by 3.  Otherwise, the number of files
                         to be copied is interpreted as NL files.

NLLIM     -  PARMFLG4 - X'04' - Force the interpretation of
                                 FILELIMIT=nnn as an NL number
             opposite - NONLLIM
             notes    - Without this parm set, if FILELIMIT=nnn is
                         in effect, then the condition of the input
                         tape, interpreted by COPYMODS as SL or NL,
                         will determine the interpretation of the
                         file limit number.

SLLIM     -  PARMFLG4 - X'08' - Force the interpretation of
                                 FILELIMIT=nnn as an SL number
             opposite - NOSLLIM
             notes    - Without this parm set, if FILELIMIT=nnn is
                         in effect, then the condition of the input
                         tape, interpreted by COPYMODS as SL or NL,
                         will determine the interpretation of the
                         file limit number.

BYTES     -  PARMFLG3 - X'04' - Report the count of bytes in each file.
             opposite - NOBYTES

CUMTOT    -  PARMFLG3 - X'08' - Report the cumulative count of bytes
                                 on the tape.
             opposite - NOCUMTOT
             notes    - CUMTOT implies that the BYTES option is also
                         set.
                        See also CUMSEP option.

LIMLABEL  -  PARMFLG4 - X'10' - Acts as though the number of label
                                 sets in the LABADDIN file is limited
                                 by the number set in the SYSIN parm:
                                 LABELIMIT=nnn.  This number is
                                 measured by counting the number of
                                 ----ENDOFLABELTRAILER cards in the
                                 LABADDIN file.  There may be more
                                 label sets in the LABADDIN file, but
                                 we disregard them.
             opposite - NOLIMLAB

OPTION    -  PARMFLG4 - X'20' - Print the OPTIONS table of options
                                 which are on or off, at the top of
                                 the SYSPRINT report.  (As assembled,
                                 this is a default.)
             opposite - NOOPTION

SUPPWTO   -  PARMFLG4 - X'40' - Suppress the WTO (message to the
                                 console) at the end of COPYMODS
                                 execution.
             opposite - NOSUPPWT
             notes    - The CBT990 message tells you how many NL
                         files, minus one, were copied.
                        Example:
                        CBT990   FILE 02581 CONTAINS 0000000 DATA BLOCKS

LBDQUICK  -  PARMFLG4 - X'80' - Quick LABLDUMP (label dump) of a tape
                                 during a READ of the tape, without
                                 reading the data blocks.  This is
                                 meant for dumping labels of a tape
                                 quickly, if it will be very time
                                 consuming to look at the data also.
             opposite - NOLBDQUI
             notes    - I created a tape with 1 million SL files, and
                         I needed to get to the end of it relatively
                         quickly.  That's why I developed this option.

CUMSEP    -  PARMFLG4 - X'01' - Report the cumulative byte counts for
                                 files on the tape, but count data
                                 bytes separately, and label bytes
                                 separately.

                        CUMSEP implies that CUMTOT is also on.

STRIP     -  PARMFLG4 - X'02' - When copying tapes, if COPYMODS sees
                                 a label, it will not copy the label
                                 to the output tapes.  This creates an
                                 NL tape from an SL tape, if the input
                                 tape is SL.
             opposite - NOSTRIP
             notes    - This option works by actually detecting the
                         label files, wherever they are, and not
                         copying them to the output tapes.  It does NOT
                         work by counting files.  Therefore, this
                         option will work on weird tapes with labels
                         that are not in their ordinary places.  Such a
                         weird tape can be created using the COPYNLNL
                         program.  STRIP was designed to rescue the
                         data from such weird tapes, as well as to
                         simply strip off the labels from ordinary SL
                         tapes.
                        LABLDUMP can save the set of labels at the same
                         time as STRIP doesn't copy them to the output
                         tapes.  The label file created by LABLDUMP
                         can be used to replace the labels on the NL
                         tapes, using the LABADDIN option, and recreate
                         the original SL tape.  But you can edit the
                         LABLDUMP file in the meanwhile, and change the
                         labels on the newly created SL tapes, any way
                         you want to.  (But if you want the system to
                         be able to treat your new SL tapes properly,
                         you should follow the rules.  See the IBM
                         manual: Using Magnetic Tapes.)

IDRCOFF   -  PARMFLG5 - X'10' - If a 3490 tape is compressed (36 track),
                                 it contains the letter P in the 36th
                                 byte of the VOL1 label.  This will
                                 cause the system to not be able to
                                 read the tape as SL, on an 18 track
                                 drive.  However, if the tape isn't
                                 REALLY in 36 track format, but it was
                                 copied from a 36 track tape using BLP,
                                 to an 18 track tape, the data isn't
                                 REALLY compressed, and we should be
                                 able to read it on an 18 track drive.
                                 The letter P on the VOL1 label gets in
                                 the way of that.  This option will
                                 strip the letter P off the VOL1 label,
                                 so the copied tape will be readable as
                                 an 18 track tape, when the tape drive
                                 is defined to the system as an 18
                                 track drive, and its data isn't really
                                 compressed.

                                 format.  The ASCII option will force
                                 interpretation of the hex values as
                                 ASCII.  The EBCDIC option (default)
                                 will force the interpretation of the
                                 hex values as EBCDIC.
             opposite - NOHEXPRT

                                 keyword.  If ENABLTMW isn't coded, or
                                 if nnn equals 0, then no leading tape
                                 marks are written to the copied tapes.

WRTLTM    -  PARMFLG5 - X'08' - Set automatically by WRITELTMS=nnn
                                 keyword.  Needs nnn not to be 0, so
                                 WRITELTMS has to be actually coded.
                                 WRITELTMS has no nonzero default.

SECOFF    -  PARMFLG6 - X'10' - In an ASCII tape, HDR1 label, there is
                                 a security byte at the 54th byte into
                                 the HDR1.  This option blanks the
                                 security byte in the copied tapes.

CODEDPRM  -  PARMFLG6 - X'80' - Produces a second OPTIONS report,
                                 printed after the first OPTIONS report,
                                 telling you how the program options
                                 were originally coded, before the
                                 COPYMODS program attempted to resolve
                                 contradictory parms.

MINMAX    -  PARMFLG6 - X'01' - Prints the minimum sized block and

             opposite - NORECSIZ
             notes    - RECSIZE implies MINMAX, because it didn't make
                         sense to show all the individual records,
                         without reporting the largest and smallest

                                 the action of the STRIP option, and
                                 to show the internal flags that it
                                 sets.  Needed to fix a problem where
                                 an (exactly) 80-byte tape block was
                                 incorrectly interpreted as a label.

KEEPVOL   -  PARMFLG6 - X'08' - Uses the VOL1 record originally on the
                                 output tape as the copied VOL1, if it
                                 is compatible with the format of the
                                 input tape's VOL1 record.

             notes    - KEEPVOL implies SHOOVL (Show Output Volumes).
                        See notes in the SHOOVL option.
                        KEEPVOL was designed for when you want to mount
                         a "scratch tape" as an output tape, and to
                         keep its volser in the copied tape.  This
                         might help you manage the output tapes using
                         a tape management system.

SHOOVL    -  PARMFLG7 - X'10' - Show the first 80 bytes of each output
                                 tape, if they exist.
             opposite - NOSHOOVL
             notes    - SHOOVL opens each output tape, reads 80 bytes
                         of it, and rewinds it.  If SHOOVL is used
                         with READ, then the OPEN is done only for
                         INPUT.  If the result will be a tape copy,
                         then the OPEN of the output tapes will be for
                         OUTPUT.  If KEEPVOL is coded, then each first
                         80 bytes (if they exist) are stored in the
                         program, and queried if they are compatible
                         with a (possible) VOL1 label on the input
                         tape. If so, then the existing VOL1 is kept
                         on the output tape.
                        SHOOVL coded without READ, will result in the
                         overlay of all output tapes by the contents
                         of the input tape.  (IMPORTANT TO KNOW.)
