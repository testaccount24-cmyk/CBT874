)F FUNCTION -

  The TSO command SHOWTCAS will display the status of your
  TERMINAL CONTROL ADDRESS SPACE (TCAS), which reflects all of
  the settings in the TSOKEYxx member of PARMLIB.

  The SHOWTCAS command has to be executed APF-authorized,
  because the information displayed, is in Subpool 231, which
  is fetch-protected storage.

  SAMPLE OUTPUT OF SHOWTCAS (without the "A" operand):

        SHOWTCAS - TERMINAL CONTROL ADDRESS SPACE - FIELDS
        --------   -------- ------- ------- -----   ------
            Display of Settings and Addresses having
             to do with the TSOKEYxx PARMLIB member

  CBT File 731 also contains APF-authorized TSO commands to
  display or change each of the eight values which may be
  specified in PARMLIB member TSOKEYxx.  These commands are
  conveniently named with the same name as the PARMLIB setting
  which specifies them.  The commands are:

     USERMAX
     RECONLIM
     BUFRSIZE
     HIBFREXT
     LOBFREXT
     SCRSIZE
     CHNLEN
     ENGTRANS

  Each of these commands displays the current number of TSO users,
  and the current setting of the parameter, when no parameters are
  entered.  You can change the setting of the parameter by entering
  a new parameter which is within the permitted range.

     Example:   USERMAX 35       (which results in the output:)

  USERMAX - VER. 1.3 - 01/03/21 - 20.51
  --------------------------------------
   Change the MAXUSERS number in the IKTTCAST
   control block.
  Current number of TSO Users:  1
  Previous value of MAXUSERS :  40
  Value of MAXUSERS reset to :  35

     Another Example:   RECONLIM  5

  RECONLIM - VER. 1.3 - 01/03/21 - 20.51
  --------------------------------------
   Change the RECONLIM number in the IKTTCAST
   control block.
  Current number of TSO Users:  1
  Previous value of RECONLIM :  3
  Value of RECONLIM reset to :  5

  and so forth with the other TCAS-related commands above.
