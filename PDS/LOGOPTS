)F FUNCTION -

  The LOGOPTS TSO command is an APF-authorized TSO command
  which is designed to change (on or off) all values that are
  controlled by the PARMLIB member IKJTSOxx with its LOGON
  keyword.

   >>>>           **** IMPORTANT NOTE ****
   >>>>  The effect of this command (on an entire LPAR) is
   >>>>  nullified only when you do a PARMLIB UPDATE(xx), SET
   >>>>  IKJTSO=xx, or an IPL.  It affects ALL users who
   >>>>  attempt to LOGON.  SO BE CAREFUL.  Its intent is to
   >>>>  show you what happens when you change LOGON options,
   >>>>  or to switch the current option temporarily.  It is
   >>>>  not intended to be used in production systems.

  Bits are set as follows for the following options:

  X'08' -  Password Phrase Support
  X'04' -  Applid Verification
  X'02' -  LOGONHERE Support
  X'01' -  Password Preprompt Support

  Where are they set?  In two control blocks:
   the TSVT and the TPVT.

  The controls we are dealing with, comprise the
  lower nibble of two control block fields, which
  must match.  In the TSVT, the upper nibble
  of the appropriate byte contains other
  information, but the corresponding upper nibble
  in the TPVT currently contains zeros.

  The lower nibble in these two fields must match:

  TSVT + x'5'   TSVTFLG1
  TPVT + x'4C'  TPVTLOGON  (our terminology,
                            not IBM's, although
                            it seems logical to
                            call it by this name.)

  If you want to switch these settings temporarily,
  then issue this APF-authorized TSO command: LOGOPTS,
  using one of the valid parms.

  DISPLAY ONLY, of the current settings, is done
  either by not entering a parameter, or by entering
  a parameter that is not S, A, H, or P.

  To turn off a bit, suffix an F to the parameter:
  For example:  LOGOPTS SF, AF, HF, or PF.

  Bit settings are found in the TSVTFLG1 field in
  the TSVT (TSO Vector Table) in the lower nibble,
  and this nibble must match the corresponding
  nibble in control block TPVT + X'4C'.

  Bits are set as follows for the following options:

  X'08' -  Password Phrase Support
  X'04' -  Applid Verification
  X'02' -  LOGONHERE Support
  X'01' -  Password Preprompt Support

  These are the LOGOPTS parameters:
  ----- --- --- ------- ----------
   S -  Password Phrase Support
   A -  Applid Verification
   H -  LOGONHERE Support
   P -  Password Preprompt Support

  USE OF THIS PROGRAM:  To turn a bit on, use the
         following parms:  To turn a bit off, use
         the same letter parm, followed by the
         letter F, as described here:

         PA   Service Activated            BIT   TO TURN
         RM                                SET   OFF
         --   -----------------            ---   -------
  LOGOPTS S - Password Phrase Support     x'08'  SF - Off
  LOGOPTS A - Applid Verification         x'04'  AF - Off
  LOGOPTS H - LOGONHERE Support           x'02'  HF - Off
  LOGOPTS P - Password Preprompt Support  x'01'  PF - Off

  LOGOPTS (anything else) - to display the current setting
                            of the TSVTFLG1 and TPVTLOGON
                            bytes. (Display does not require
                            APF-authorization.)


)X SYNTAX  -
       LOGOPTS  S       | SF       (Password Phrase Support)
                A       | AF       (Applid Verification)
                H       | HF       (LOGONHERE Support)
                P       | PF       (Password Pre-prompt support)

  REQUIRED - For changing bits, any of the permitted operands
             For displaying the current settings, no parameter,
               or else an invalid parameter.
