)F FUNCTION -

  Display/Change the 8-character TSO userid support status of
  your z/OS system.  (Valid for z/OS 2.3 and higher)

  Status:  TSO command - APF authorized.

  The TSO command TSVT8 checks or throws the switch which
  turns ON/OFF TSO 8-character userid support.

  The switch is located in the TSVT (TSO Vector Table) control
  block at location X'06'.  If 8-character userid is on, then
  the value of the switch is X'08'.  If off, the value is X'07'.
  The value for a z/OS system previous to 2.2 is x'00'.


  You can change this value, both in the TSVT (where it counts)
  and the TPVT (where it shows), by entering a number after the
  command name.  Entering 8 will turn on 8-character id support
  and entering 7 will turn off 8-character userid support.
