)F FUNCTION -
  THE BLKDISK COMMAND COMPUTES AN OPTIMAL BLOCKSIZE FOR A DATA SET
  TO BE PLACED ON A YYYY DISK PACK.  THE PROGRAM OUTPUT INCLUDES
  THE FOLLOWING REPORTS:
     1.  A SUMMARY BLOCKSIZE REPORT FOR THE GIVEN LRECL AND KEY
         LENGTH WHICH INCLUDES THE RECOMMENDED BLOCKSIZE TO USE.
     2.  A RECOMMENDED DATA SET SPACE ALLOCATION.
     3.  A OPTIONAL TRACK CAPACITY REPORT FOR THE PROVIDED KEY LENGTH.

  THE RECOMMENDED BLOCKSIZE VALUE IS FOR DATA SETS IN WHICH THE
  PREDOMINANT ACCESS IS SEQUENTIAL; FOR DATA SETS WHERE RANDOM
  ACCESS TIME IS CRITICAL OR THE USUAL ACCESS IS RANDOM, A SMALL
  BLOCKSIZE (500-2000 BYTES) SHOULD PROBABLY BE USED.

  THE RECOMMENDED BLOCKSIZE WILL USUALLY TEND TO BE NEAR A HALF-TRACK
  FIGURE AS THIS IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE MOST EFFICIENT IN TERMS OF
  THE TRADE-OFFS AMONG BUFFER SIZE, SECONDARY STORAGE REQUIREMENTS,
  CHANNEL USE, NUMBER OF INPUT/OUTPUTS AND OVERALL PROCESSING TIME.
  THIS FIGURE IS ONLY A GENERAL GUIDE; FOR MAXIMAL EFFICIENCY
  CONSIDERING OTHER FACTORS, STUDY THE GENERATED BLOCKSIZE SUMMARY
  REPORT OR A TRACK CAPACITY REPORT.

  THE PROGRAM'S RECOMMENDATIONS ASSUME A FAIRLY LARGE AMOUNT OF DATA
  IS TO BE STORED; DATA SETS WHICH OCCUPY ONLY A FEW TRACKS SHOULD
  PROBABLY BE PLACED IN PARTITIONED DATA SETS.  IN CASES WHERE THIS
  IS NOT FEASIBLE, THE USE OF A SMALL BLOCKSIZE (2400 - 4000 BYTES)
  MAY BE A GOOD ALTERNATIVE PRACTICE.
