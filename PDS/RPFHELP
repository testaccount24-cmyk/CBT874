                 (Robs's Programming Facility V 1 R 7)


  RPF is developed by Rob Prins for Skybird Systems and used at
  the Hercules project.

  It operates as a command processor under TSO/VTAM in a MVS38J,
  MVS/380, MVS/XA, MVS/ESA, OS/390 and z/OS operating system.
  With the exception of MVS38J addressing mode 31 is available, so you
  you can edit datasets or PDS members up to 2,000,000 lines.

  RPF provides an easy way of entering and editing data on an IBM3270
  terminal.  The major change in Version 1, Release 7 is the size of
  of the 3270 terminal. Most of the panels will support screens up
  62 lines x 160 columns. That is the size of the 3290 terminal.
  A few panels will not support this size, but reverts back to a 3270
  model 2 (24 lines x 80 columns).

  It also provides you with the ability of ASSEMBLE and
  LINK-EDIT programs in the FOREGROUND. The UTILITY has functions for
  creation and deletion of data sets, EDITing a VTOC, PDS and LIBRARIAN
  maintenance and the dataset list function.

  Editing of numbered or unnumbered card images is possible in
  fullscreen mode.  The '*' mentioned in some subcommands of EDIT, is
  the current line. (1st line on the screen).

  I *,n  will insert N lines after the current line, 'DEL *,n'
  will delete n lines starting with the current line, 'DEL *,99999999'
  will delete till the end of the workspace starting with the current
  line. If you delete the whole workspace, RPF will terminate the
  EDIT function.

  For a description of all commands, select -2- from the RPF Help
  menu.

  If you want to delete a certain line or lines use the 'DEL N(,M)'
  command.  You can INSERT and REPEAT after certain lines too.
  For changing character strings in the workspacethe 'C'
  command is available.  You can change from num to nonum mode,
  by entering the 'UNNUM' command.  The 'RENUM ' command sets the
  editor in num mode.

  The 'SCL' and 'SCR' subcommands sets the display from col 1-72 or
  9-80.  The 'COB' and 'NOCOB' subcommands sets the display on cols 7-78
  or 1-72.  After the 'COB' command, you are in COBOL mode, so the
  seq. nrs are in cols 1-6.
  When a file is edited, the workspace is automaticly cleared.
  If you want to append another file, select 'APPEND=YES'
  on the dataset menu.  OS datasets, LIBRARIAN datasets and
  PANVALET datasets can be processed with EDIT.  All files are
  allocated dynamically. If an error occurs during dynamic allocation, a
  return code is displayed. Select -3- on the HELP MENU to get an
  explanation of the return codes.

  The TEST function is implemented only for maintanance by the RPF
  BUILDERS and should not be used by unauthorized users.

  In each selection menu, the 'END' PFkey is supported (PF3 and PF15).

  RPF OPERATOR MODE enables you to look at the current system activity.
  When using RPFOPER, enter 'HELP' to list the available functions.

  RPF works in fullscreen mode, which means that the terminal is also
  set to fullscreen mode. If a non-fullscreen message (like a SEND
  message) is received three *** appear on the screen. Hit the Enter key
  to restore your screen.  If the screen is not properly restored, enter
  a '?' to restore.

  The use of PFK's is possible during EDIT, BROWSE, PDS, Data set
  selection list, LIBRARIAN functions and all selection menus.
  These PFK's can be altered by using the DEFAULTS menu
  This defaults menu is option '0' on the main menu.
  With this menu it is possible to alter the default workspace size,
  allocation of OS, LIBRARIAN and PANVALET datasets and the mentioned
  PFK's

  All these defaults will be saved on the RPF profile cluster if
  available.
